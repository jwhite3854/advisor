                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor...</p>
                <p>My friend wanted the ability to browse movies depending on his mood and his love for Tom Cruise. In his original vision, this tool simply allowed him to more easily find Tom Cruise's science fiction works.</p>
                <p>I thought users might want to search by other people or genres, but that could just be too generous.</p>
                <p>Genres and keywords are created by the TMBb userbase. Person names have also been submitted by users, but I have filtered the results down to a given popularity rating. Also, in the cases of multiple people sharing the same name (ex. six cases of "Chris Evans"), I have removed all but identity with the highest popularity rating. Person popularity ratings are determined by the TMDb community.</p>
